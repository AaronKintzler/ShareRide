# ShareRide
A web platform for coordinating relief efforts in disaster areas

# What is Share Ride: 
Share Ride is a design for a Webapp to help volunteers coordinate themselves in disaster areas. Often when volunteers arrive on a scene, there is not a centralized source of information about the needs of the community or what work needs to be done. Churches and other organizations will set up small bases of operation to organize these efforts, but on a larger scale these groups don’t use technology to talk to one another. If a van carrying containers of hygiene products arrives on site, they may not know where to deliver it to help the most people. Share Ride will attempt to give volunteers a means of communicating with each other, identifying jobs to complete, and visualizing the movement of resources and people in a relief effort zone. 

# Semester 1: 
The goal for the first semester is to get a basic framework for the website. This includes the webapp layout, navigation design, and basic backend setup. Essentially, this semester is building a skeleton for the rest of the advanced features to be built into. The result at the end of the semester is a basic Webapp with intuitive navigation and the pages setup similarly to the Figure 1. Also, there needs to be a login feature that distinguishes between different users and stores that information. 

A placeholder can be used for the map and the user. The important thing is to get a solid framework to build the other features to be built on. Make sure that your code is well commented, the files are well named, and the progress is well-documented. A strong foundation is necessary for every group working after this one. 

We highly recommend using the Ionic Framework for this stage of development. It has built-in plugins for implementing most of the goals of the Share-Ride Project. We provide resources for using and learning about this framework below.

Important: This part of the project will need to be finished before any of the other parts can be done. The others can be done in different order, but this one has to be finished first. 

# Semester 2: 
The goal for the 2nd semester team is to further refine the Webapp design and to get the mapping function of the Share Ride Webapp fully operational. This will include adding functionality to the pages created by team 1. Clicking pages should display the information stored in the database. For example, navigating to the Open Request page should allow the user to accurately input new information, which can be then searched by the Webapp. It will also include linking that data to geographical locations on the map. 

Goals for the Mapping Function: 
  - Users have a single Geo-position tied to them
  - Organizations can have multiple Geo-positions for resources/needs/shelters
  - Organization Geo-positions must be displayed to a map on the page
  - Geo-Positions must be searchable by users (by organization, by need, by locality, by       available resource)
  - Users can address needs of an organization, fulfill a delivery
  - Basic database functionality (multiple users on the “map” at once)
